madlib = f"Two {noun1}, both alike in dignity, In fair {place1}, where we lay our scene,\
From ancient {noun2} break to new mutiny,\
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\
A pair of star-cross`d {noun3} take their life;\
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows\
Do with their {noun4} bury their parents` strife.\
The fearful passage of their {adj1} love,\
And the continuance of their parents` rage,\
Which, but their children`s end, nought could {verb1},\
Is now the {num1} hours` traffic of our stage;\
The which if you with {adj2} {bdyprt1} attend,\
What here shall {verb2}, our toil shall strive to mend"
